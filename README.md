ðŸš¦ Traffic Management System
A smart and efficient web-based system designed to manage and monitor traffic flow using automation and real-time data analysis. This project simulates intelligent traffic control to reduce congestion and improve road safety.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Traffic Management System uses predefined traffic patterns and simulated sensor inputs to dynamically manage traffic signals. The system can be extended with real-time data integration for practical deployment in smart cities.

ðŸ’¡ Features
Simulates dynamic traffic signal control based on vehicle density

Visual representation of traffic flow at intersections

Manual override and emergency signal control

Responsive web interface for monitoring

Real-time signal switching logic implementation

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Flask (Python)

Database: MySQL (for storing traffic data)

Additional Tools: Python logic for traffic signal simulation

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/Sri-1660/TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.git
cd TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Create and activate a virtual environment

python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required packages


pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the MySQL database and configure the connection in the Flask app

Run the Flask server

python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000
